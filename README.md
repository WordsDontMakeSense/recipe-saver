## Usage
Recipe Saver is intended to be used to simplify the process of managing all of your recipes. While physical recipe books do work, you don't want to lose them. Recipe Saver solves this issue by allowing you to export your recipes as JSON files and re-import them. This allows for storage in any method: locally, in the cloud, physically even (if you like typing JSON by hand).
## Installation
Open a new terminal instance and enter the following commands:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/WordsDontMakeSense/recipe-saver.git
cd recipe-saver
python3 -m http.server
```
You should then be able to access the site through your web browser. The default port is 8000.
## Requirements
