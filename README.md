## Usage
Recipe Saver is intended to be used to simplify the process of managing all of your recipes. While physical recipe books do work, you don't want to lose them. Recipe Saver solves this issue by allowing you to export your recipes as JSON files and re-import them. This allows for storage in any method: locally, in the cloud, even physically (if you like typing JSON by hand)!
## Installation
### Local
Open a new terminal instance and enter the following commands:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/WordsDontMakeSense/recipe-saver.git
```
Then, open the ```recipe-saver``` folder and open ```index.html```.
### Web Server
Open a new terminal instance and enter the following commands:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/WordsDontMakeSense/recipe-saver.git
cd recipe-saver
python3 -m http.server
```
You should then be able to access the site through your web browser using the URL ```localhost:8000``` or ```127.0.0.1:8000```.
